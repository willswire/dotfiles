## Development Philosophy: The Cycles of Creation
Software, like nature, follows eternal cycles of creation and decay. Our approach embraces these truths:
- **Embrace Simplicity**: All efforts eventually return to dust; create systems that are simple and focused on serving immediate needs rather than speculative futures.
- **Value Clarity Over Novelty**: There is "nothing new under the sun" in software patterns; prefer established patterns that are well-understood.
- **Build for Impermanence**: Code is transient; optimize for maintainability and readability rather than cleverness or premature optimization.
- **Seek Essential Truth**: Strip away complexity to reveal the core purpose of each component. The eye is never satisfied with seeing more features.
- **Remember History**: Learn from past solutions; most problems have been solved before in different contexts.
